# Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## What
Purpose
- Optimize Output of large language models

How
- Reference an authoritative knowledge base outside of it's training date sources before generating a respons

## Why
Challenges of Traditional LLMs
- Present false information when no known answer
- Presenting out of date information
- Present generic data instead of a specific answer
- Using non-authoritative sources as fact
- Terminology confusion due to cross-domain nature

Benefits
- Cost effective implementation
    - Do not need to retrain models
- Current information
    - Use RAG to connect to up to date information
- Enhanced Trust
    - LLM can prsent data with source attribution
    - Users can verify data themselves
- Increase developer control
    - Restrict sensitive information
    - Change information sources to adapt to new requirements or cross-functional useage

## How
- Create External Data
    - External Data is the additional data outside of the thraining data
    - Can accept a wide variety of data types (files, database, long-form text)
    - Embedding Language Models - AI technique that convertsdata into numerical representations and stores as a vector
- Retreive Relevant Data
    - User query is converted to a vector representation
    - Then mated with the vector databases
    - Database returns data that is highly related to the user query
- Augment LLM Prompt
    - RAG model augments the use inpur by adding the relecant retieved data in contxt
    - Uses prompt engineering techniques to generate an accurate answer
- Updating external data
    - Asynchronously update documents
    - Asynchronously updateembedding representation of documents
    - Can be real time or batch depending on needs
