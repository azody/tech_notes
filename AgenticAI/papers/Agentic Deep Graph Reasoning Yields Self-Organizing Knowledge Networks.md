## Abstract
- Core Idea: An agentic, autonomous graph expansion framework that iteratively structures and refines knowledge in situ
    - *in situ*: In the original place or arrangement:
- Differentiator: couples a reasoning-native large language model with a continually updated graph representation
- The How
    - At each step, the system actively generates new concepts and relationships, merges them into a global graph, and formulates subsequent prompts based on its evolving structure.
    - Over hundreds of iterations, new nodes and edges continue to appear without saturating
- Key Benefit: Scale-free network
- Appliication: Material Sciences

## Introduction

### Foundational Work

Problems with existing LLMs
- Emphasize predictive accuracy and single-step outputs
- Do not have the layered and reflective approach similiar to human thinking
    - Relational modeling
- Molecular biologoy was mentioned (Jeff Chang was not)
- Fundamental Challenge: build AI that synthezises rather than just memorizing information

Category Theory
- Recursive structuring
- Hierarchal representations can unify data across different domains
- HIerarchal represetnations can enable higher level abstraction


Graph Systems
- Naturaul analog to relational thinking
- Possible to identify hubs, briding nodes and interconnected communities
- As nodes accumulate form clusters, emergent properties can reveal cross domain synergies and overlooked gaps in knowledge
    - Helps LLMs do more tha just memorize facts

Tranformer architectures
- Think of as Graph+
    - Attention operates over relational structures rather than raw token sequences 
    - Each attention head effectively tests for isomorphisms in local neighborhoods of the graph
        - *Isomorphism*: type of transformation that tells you two objects have the same 
        structure
        - Helps determin if there are global and/or local dependencies

Tranformer architectures + Category Theory
- Nodes can be treated as object, Edges can be treated as morphisms
- Higher level concepts emerge from functorial mappings

Tranformer architectures + Category Theory Results
- Simpler building blocks can be combined and reconfigured to form increasingly sophisticated representations
- By using graph-native modeling and viewing nodes and edges as composable abstractions, such a model may be able to recognize and reapply learned configurations in new contexts
- Rearrange the building blocks and you mayu learn something new

Summary
- In effect, graph-native attention mechanisms treat interconnected concepts as first-class entities, enabling the discovery of new behaviors or interactions that purely sequence-based methods might otherwise overlook.


Fundamental Challenges
- Build AI systems to build and refine their own knowledge structures across iterations
    - Graphs can be useful strategies to endow AI models with relational capabilities
        - within the framework of creating graph-native attention mechanisms
        - training models to use graphs as native abstractions during learned reasoning phases

Vision Surrounding Paper
- By endowing large language models with recursively expanding knowledge graph capabilities, we aim to show how stepwise reasoning can support open-ended discovery and conceptual reorganization
    -  Earlier work on graph-native reasoning has demonstrated that models explicitly taught how to reason in graphs and abstractions can lead to systems that generalize better and are more interpretable
    - Here we explore whether we can push this approach toward ever-larger graphs, creating extensive in situ graph reasoning loops where models spend hours or days developing complex relational structures before responding to a task
- Issues
    - Will repeated expansions naturally preserve the networkâ€™s relational cohesion, or risk splintering into disconnected clusters
    - Does the continuous addition of new concepts and edges maintain meaningful structure, or lead to saturation and redundancy?
    - To what extent do bridging nodes, which may initially spark interdisciplinary links, remain influential over hundreds of iterations?

Findings suggest that, rather than collapsing under its own complexity, the system retains coherent, open-ended development, pointing to new possibilities for large-scale knowledge formation in AI-driv1en research for scientific exploration.

High Level Algorithmic Paradigm
- At each iteration i
    - The model generates reasoning tokens
    - From the response, a local graph Gi local is extracted and merged with the global knowledge graph G
    - The evolving graph is stored in multiple formats for visualization and analysis
    - Instead of letting the model respond to the task, a follow-up task is generated based on the latest extracted nodes and edges in Gi local
        - Ensures iterative refinement, so that model generates yet more reasoning tokens, and as part of that process, new nodes and edges. 
- The process continues until the stopping condition i < N is met, yielding a final structured knowledge graph G

### Knowledge Graph Expansion Approaches

Organize Relational understanding of the world
- Historically manually curated ontologies
    - Now massive automatically contructed repositores of facts

Early approached focused on infomration extraction from text somg pattern based or open=domain extractors
- DIPRE algorithm - bootstrapped relational patterns from seed examples and reeanforcment loop
- KnowItAll - open ended, autonmous "generate and test" paradigm
- TextRunner - Open Information Extraction
- ReVerb - Open Information Extraction

Not fully unsupervised, need seed facts, but largely unsupervised. These provide a toolkit for knowledge graph expansion

### Recursive and Autonmous Expansion Techniques

NELL project (Never Ending Language Learner)
- Runs 24/7 and iterativel extracts new beliefs from the web and integrating into knowledge base
- Couples multiple learners
    - parsing, classification, relation extraction etc..
- Recursive approach uses existing knowledge to guide future extractions
    - Self correcting

Knowledge Vault
- Automatic knowledge base population by fusing facts with probalistic inference
- Created candidate facts with probability of correctness

Reinforcment Learning and Agentic Frameworks
- Recent research exploring agent based and reinforcment learnning frameworks
- Allows an agent to make multi-hop queries and sequential decisions to discover new facts
    - Explore kowledge graph connections in a guided manner
    - Reward signal for correct or novel information
- Replicate cross-domain research

### Relation to Earlier Work and Key Hypothesis

Dynamically grow a knowledge graph in situ 
- Core concept as NELL and KNowledge Vault
- Difference s graph ecpansion is not probablistic, it utilizes a graph-native reasoning LLM
    - Each new edge is both informed and used for the next step of reasoning

Synthesis of preexisting ideas
- DeepPath can efficiently navigate graphs, but does not grow them by generating new concept or hypothesis
- NELL and Knowledge Vault demonstrate large-scale extraction and integration of facts

Work here treats reasoning as an active recursive process that expands knowledge graph
-  Aligns with scientific and biological discovery
- Approach will tracks and justifies each newly added node or relation

### Hypothesis
We hypothesize that recursive graph expansion enables self-organizing knowledge formation,
allowing intelligence-like behavior to emerge without predefined ontologies, external supervision, or centralized control. Using a pre-trained model, Graph-PReFLexOR (an autonomous graph-reasoning model trained on a corpus of biological and biologically inspired materials principles) we demonstrate that knowledge graphs can continuously expand in a structured yet open-ended manner, forming scale-free networks with emergent conceptual hubs and interdisciplinary bridge nodes. Our findings suggest that intelligence-like reasoning can arise from recursive self-organization, challenging conventional paradigms and advancing possibilities for autonomous scientific discovery and scalable epistemic reasoning.

### Basic Analysis of Recursive Graph Growth

Number of nodes and edges exhibit linear growth iterations
- Indicates reasoning process systematically expands the graph without saturation

Number of edges slightly steeper than number of nodes
- Suggets each new concept introduced is integrated into an increasingly dense network

Average degree of the graph stewadily increases and than stabilizes at around 6 edges per node
- Signifies a balance betweren exploration and connectivitiy

Size of the largest connected component (LCC) grows proportionally to total number of node
- Reinforces observation that the graphs is a unified traversable structure rather than fragmenting

### Structurual Evolution of Recursive Knowledge Graph

Louvian modularity
- Average shortest path length and graph diameter over iteration
- Measures strenghth of communitiy structure within the graph
- Results: Early peak at 0.75 and than stabilized at 0.70
    - Indicates model preserves structuraul coherence
    - Recursive expansion does not collapse existing conceptual groups

Average Shortest Path Length (SPL)
- Results: Increases sharply before stabilizing
    - Increase due to number of new nodes introduced originally
    - Subsequent recursion integrates into existing structure
        - Indicates system does not suffer from runaway growth problems

Graph Diameter
- Results: Stepwise function that stabilizes around 16-18
    - Stabilization indicates ability to autonmously maintain structured conceptual groupiong
    - Resembles human-like hierarchal knowledge formation
