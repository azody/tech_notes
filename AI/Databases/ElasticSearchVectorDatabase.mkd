# Notes on Elastic Search Vector Database

## What is IT

Embedding
- Data that has been converted into an array of numbers
    - Array of numbers is known as a vector
        - Contains patterns of relationships
        - Act as a multi dimesnional map to measure simularity
            - Dog and puppy are used together frequently, the vector would contain numbers that are close together (0.5 and 0.51)
            - Has hundreds of dimensions
        - Words, images and other data types can be turned into vectors

Vector Database
- Where embeddings are stored
- Use cases
    - Searching - where results are returned in order of relevance to a query
        - Most commonly used
    - Clustering - text strings are grouped by simalarity
    - Recomendations - items with related text string are recomended
    - Classification - Where text strings are classified by their most similiar label
- How to create an embedding with OpenAI
    - Post request to /embeddings
        - model and input as parameters
        - text-embedding-ada-002
            - cheapest option
- Creating a Table
    - CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS myvectortable(
        text TEXT,
        vecto BLOB
    )
- Inserting data
    - INSERT INTO myvectortable (text, vector) VALUES ("dog"), JSON_ARRAY_PACK("returned from open ai")
    - Add more as needed
- Find closes match
    - SELECT tedxt, dot_product(vector, JSON_ARRAY_PACK("search vector[]")) as score FROM myvectortable ORDERBY score DESC limit 5
